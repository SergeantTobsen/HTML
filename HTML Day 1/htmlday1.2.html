<body>
    <p> <span>Here's to being human</span>
        <p> <span> All the pain and suffering</span>
            <p> <div> There's beauty in the bleeding</div>
       
              <p>At least you feel something </p>
                <div>I wish I knew what it was like
                    <p> To care enough to carry on
                        <p>I wish I knew what it was like
        To find a place where I belong, but
        I am machine
        I never sleep
        I keep my eyes wide open
        I am machine
        A part of me
        Wishes I could just feel something
        I am machine
        I never sleep
        Until I fix what's broken
        I am machine
        A part of me
        Wishes I could just feel something
        Here's to being human
        Taking it for granted
        The highs and lows of living
        To getting second chances
        I wish I knew what it was like
        To care about what's right or wrong
        I wish someone could help me find
        Find a place where I belong, but
        I am machine
        I never sleep
        I keep my eyes wide open
        I am machine </pre>
        </p>
